# A4I 2026 - Challenge 4: Adaptive Evacuation Readiness & Vulnerable Community Planning
# Headless fallback for notebooks/c4_01_load_explore.ipynb
#
# Rebuilds the same BigQuery tables the notebook produces, from a pre-staged
# snapshot in Cloud Storage. Use this when a Colab Enterprise runtime is slow or
# unavailable, or when one of the upstream publishers is not cooperating.
#
# Run it from the repo root in Cloud Shell (no chmod needed - invoke with bash):
#     bash scripts/load.sh                 # defaults to FL
#     bash scripts/load.sh TX
#     bash scripts/load.sh --list          # show available states
#
# You still want the notebook if you can run it. Section 2 shows you the
# differentiator failing at the question you most need answered, and Section 6
# walks through five defects in this federal data that will otherwise bite you
# silently. This script gets you the same tables without any of that.
